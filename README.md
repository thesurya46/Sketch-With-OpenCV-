🎨 Air Sketch using Hand Gestures (OpenCV + MediaPipe)

Draw in the air using just your fingers!
This project uses computer vision and hand-gesture recognition to turn your webcam into an interactive sketching canvas.

You can:

✍️ Draw by pinching your index finger & thumb

🧼 Clear the canvas using a virtual CLEAR button

🖐️ Control everything without touching the keyboard or mouse

Move finger while pinched → Draw lines

Pinch + touch CLEAR button → Reset canvas

Release pinch → Stop drawing
